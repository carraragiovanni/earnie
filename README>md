Build an iMessage-style web app that lets users send and receive SMS/MMS through Twilio-backed inboxes.
	•	Messaging core: Receive inbound messages via Twilio webhooks, persist them to a conversation thread, and render them in a real-time chat UI. Send outbound messages by calling the Twilio Messages API.
	•	Inboxes: Allow users to create Inboxes (containers for one or more phone numbers) and link each inbox to a specific Twilio configuration (e.g., account/subaccount). Each inbox should store (or reference) the Twilio phone numbers assigned to it.
	•	Twilio credentials: Provide a secure settings flow where users enter and manage their Twilio Account SID and Auth Token (and any additional identifiers you require, such as a Messaging Service SID). Credentials must be encrypted at rest and access-controlled.
	•	Contacts: Support a contacts database with configurable custom fields. At minimum, allow custom fields of type text, number, and date, and make those fields available throughout the app (search, filters, and conversation context).
	•	AI responses (optional per inbox or conversation): Let users enable an AI-assisted reply mode that calls an OpenAI endpoint to generate suggested responses using the conversation history, with a recency bias (i.e., recent messages weighted more heavily than older ones). Responses should be presented as drafts for user review (with an option to later support auto-send if desired).
